otserv 0.2.3
---------------
What is this?
	otserv is a programm that acts like a tibia server.
	You can connect to it, walk around, talk, create items.

How does it work?
	Just start otserv.exe. Then, you need Tibia 7.1. 7.11
	doesnt work as you cant specify a server to connect to.
	Set the server IP in the client to 127.0.0.1
	Then connect like to the normal tibia server.
	Leave account number and password blank.
	Never ever enter your real acc# and/or password when
	not connecting to the CIP servers.
	Then you are logged in.

What's New?
	- Map no longer saves on crash
	- !d command to remove items
  	- !s command to save the map
	- lag should be gone
	- a nice new installer

How do I use this new stuff?
	- Map no longer saves on crash
	  The map is no longer saved automatically, see the !s
	  command for details.

	- !d command to remove items
	  Turn so you are facing the item you want to delete,
	  then say !d and the topmost item on that tile will
 	  be deleted. If you want to delete a lower item, you
	  have to use !d multiple times.

  	- !s command to save the map
	  The server no longer saves automatically so use !s
	  regularly to save your work.

	- lag should be gone
	  Just enjoy.

	- a nice new installer
	  If you read this, you already found out how to use it.

How to use the old stuff?
	Create items by saying !i <itemid>
	Delete items by saying !d
	Save the map by saying !s
	Shutdown the server by saying !q

Problems?
	If you should ever have problems, that your client
	crashes when you login, you have to delete the map
	(otserv.map) and replace it with otserv_default.map.
