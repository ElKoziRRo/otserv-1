What is this?
	OTServ is an emulator of the famous game; Tibia. It acts as a server
	that lets people play on.
	You can do a lot in-game. Such as walking, talking, trading, hunting and more.

How does it work?
	In the past Otserv could be played on Tibia 7.1 or 7.11.
	Otserv is now played using Tibia 7.4 or Tibia 7.41.
	To play it you can either download the IP changer (works with
	only Tibia 7.4) or change the shortcut to Tibia.
	If you are making a shortcut to it, open the properties of the shortcut
	and you should see a box marked "Target:" and should look roughly
	like this: "C:/tibia directory/Tibia.exe".
	on the end it will have host and port properties on it, so then the target box
	will be like the following:
	
	"C:/<Tibia directory>/Tibia.exe" host 127.0.0.1 port 7171
	
	Once that's done, start the Otserv up, quite simple, just execute otserv.exe by
	double clicking it. Then startup Tibia by double clicking its shortcut you made earlier,
	then go to Options and Network and tick off "Test Server Login". Then login with the
	following:
		Account Number: 111111
		Password: tibia
	And check it out. Once you are done, have a look around in the folders
	and take a look at the config. :)

What's New?
	-Actions (when using a tile or item)
	-SQL can be used for accounts and players
	-Crash tracking
	-Monsters
	-Spawns
	-Commands
	-Autowalk
	-Binary map also available (JXB3 / OTM)
	-Enhanced items database
	-Runes with charges
	-Depots
	-And more!


How do I use this new stuff?
	I'm just going over what might not be familiar to you here.

	The word "actions" might be unfamiliar to you. What it is an action?
	For instance when you click on a door it will open, or drinking mana-fluids.
	There is other cool stuff such as SQL-support, This is useful if you have a big community of
	players for your server. You can use the other option which is xml-based which is good for beginners.
	Binary map, well this seems quite new doesn't it. For a long time maps have been in xml format
	and nowadays some maps are like 20 megabytes large which takes quite long to load. So you can now
	convert your xml map to a binary map format by a simple converter. This can be found at the OTfans.net Forums.

Problems?
	The server is now stable nowadays, but if you do find bugs you can report them at the CVS Bug Report board
	on OTFans Forums (http://otfans.net/index.php?act=SF&s=&f=78). If your server crashes, you should get a report generated
	at your Otserv folder named report.txt, you should also report this at the CVS Report Board, this report will help solving
	bugs a lot.
