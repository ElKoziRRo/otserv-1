What is this?
	OTserv is a free MMORPG emulation, that creates a own gameworld server,
        based on the CIPsoft's Tibia.

How does it work?
	In the past Otserv could be played on Tibia 7.1 or 7.11.
	Otserv is now played using Tibia 7.4 or Tibia 7.41.
	To play it you can either download the IP changer (works with
	only Tibia 7.4) or change the shortcut to Tibia.
	If you are making a shortcut to it, open the properties of the shortcut
	and you should see a box marked "Target:" and should look roughly
	like this: "C:/tibia directory/Tibia.exe".
	on the end it will have host and port properties on it, so then the target box
	will be like the following:
	
	"C:/<Tibia directory>/Tibia.exe" host HOSTNAME port PORT
	
        where HOSTNAME is the IP or HostName of the server and PORT is the port where the server acts.
        if the server is located on your machine, it will be "host localhost port 7171".

	Once that's done, start the Otserv up, quite simple, just execute otserv.exe by
	double clicking it. Then startup Tibia by double clicking its shortcut you made earlier,
	then go to Options and Network and tick off "Test Server Login". Then login with the
	following:
		Account Number: 111111
		Password: tibia
	And check it out. Once you are done, have a look around in the folders
	and take a look at the config. :)

	NEVER ever enter your real acc# and/or password when
	not connecting to the CIP servers.
	Then you are logged in.

What's New?
	- Full rearranged protocol and game system
	- Actions (when using a tile or item)
	- SQL databases (for accounts and players)
	- Crash tracking
	- Monsters
	- Spawns
	- Commands
	- Autowalk
	- Binary map also available (JXB3 / OTM)
	- Enhanced items database
	- Runes with charges
	- Depots
	- And more!

How do I use this new stuff?
	I'm just going over what might not be familiar to you here.

	The word "actions" might be unfamiliar to you. What it is an action?
	For instance when you click on a door it will open, or drinking mana-fluids.
	There is other cool stuff such as SQL-support, This is useful if you have a big community of
	players for your server. You can use the other option which is xml-based which is good for beginners.
	Binary map, well this seems quite new doesn't it. For a long time maps have been in xml format
	and nowadays some maps are like 20 megabytes large which takes quite long to load. So you can now
	convert your xml map to a binary map format by a simple converter. This can be found at the OTfans.net Forums.

MySQL Server
	SQL has been introduced to otserv, in previous releases, players, accounts, items and others were and
	still are in XML, but now people have the choice to have thier players and accounts and items in an SQL
	Server database. Having an SQL database is good for people that like to easily edit players, accounts or whatever
	in the aspect. For example you can set all players have capacity of 1000 in ONE instruction ;). It has
	many advantages.
	
		Instructions to setup a server:
			1. Download Xampp (not Xampp Lite) (http://www.apachefriends.org/download.php?xampp-win32-1.4.14-installer.exe)
			2. Install
			3. Open "xampp-control.exe"
			4. Click on the buttons to open "MySQL" and "Apache"
			5. Go on your browser and type in the address bar "localhost" or "127.0.0.1"
			6. Find the name "phpmyadmin" and go to it
			7. You will find some controls, make a database called "otserv"
			8. Now you will be taken to the database, click the tab "SQL"
			9. Goto the file named sample.sql, its in the folder this README is in.
			10. Copy the text in that file and paste it in that text box on your browser then press ok ;)
			11. SQL instructions have been executed and a sample account(Account number: 1, Password: test) and player should be made.
			12. Now go to your folder and open config.lua and make sure the SQL Stuff there is correct such as the mysql user and password ;).
				Should be all correct for you anyway ;).
			13. Start the server and login.
			
	
Problems?
	The server is now stable nowadays, but if you do find bugs you can report them at the 
	CVS Bug Report board on OTFans Forums (http://otfans.net/index.php?act=SF&s=&f=78). If your 
	server crashes, you should get a report generated at your Otserv folder named report.txt, 
	you should also report this at the CVS Report Board, this report will help solving bugs a lot.
