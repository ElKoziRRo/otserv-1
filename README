============================================
========== OpenTibia Server 0.6.3 ==========
============================================
===== www.otserv.org	www.otfans.net =====
============================================


What is this?
	OTServ is a free MMORPG emulation, that creates a own gameworld server,
	based on the CIPSoft's Tibia.

How does it work?
	In the past OTServ could be played on Tibia 7.1, 7.11, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.61, 7.7, 7.71, 7.8, 7.81, ,7.82, 7.9, 7.92, 8.0, 8.1, 8.11, 8.2 ,8.21, 8.22, 8.3, 8.4, 8.41, 8.42, 8.5, 8.51, 8.52.
	OTServ is now played using Tibia 8.54.

	To connect Tibia client to OTServ you will have to use an IP changer, you can get one here 
	http://www.otchanger.net/

	Once that's done, start the OTServ up, quite simple, just execute otserv.exe by
	double clicking it. Then startup Tibia by double clicking its shortcut you made earlier
	.
	Then login with the following:
		Account Number: 111111
		Password: tibia
	To do so you have to execute some sql queries from schema.mysql, schema.pgsql or even schema.sqlite.
	And check it out. Once you are done, have a look around in the folders
	and take a look at the config.lua :)

	NEVER ever enter your real acc# and/or password when not connecting to the CIP servers.
	Then you are logged in.

Features?
    many ...(almost all are here):

How do I use this new stuff?
	I'm just going over what might not be familiar to you here.

	The word "actions" might be unfamiliar to you. What it is an action?
	For instance when you click on a door it will open, or drinking mana-fluids.
	"movement" is any thing you do when moving: stepping in or out a tile, adding
	or removing an item from/to somewhere, equipping or de-equipping an item, etc..
	"talkactions" are like actions, but they mean for talking. So, everytime you
	say something, it's a talkaction.

	There is other cool stuff such as SQL-support. It includes MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL and ODBC support.
	Google it if you don't know it, we won't explain other softwares here ;p

	Binary map, well this seems quite new doesn't it. For a long time maps have been in xml format
	and nowadays some maps are like 20 megabytes large which takes quite long to load. So you can now
	convert your xml map to a binary map format by a simple converter. This can be found at the OTfans.net Forums.
	(Xml maps was in 7.4-7.1 ?)
    	Binary house storage it is also new feature in otserv before it was relational storage (u can change storage in config.lua)
	which takes long to save tiles in houses so otserv team make it in db but in binary storage.
