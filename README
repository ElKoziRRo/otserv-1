otserv 0.2.7
=======
What is this?
	otserv is a programm that acts like a tibia server.
	You can connect to it, walk around, talk, create items.

How does it work?
	Just start otserv.exe. Then, you need Tibia 7.1. 7.11
	doesnt work as you cant specify a server to connect to.
	Set the server IP in the client to 127.0.0.1
	Then connect like to the normal tibia server.
	Leave account number and password blank.
	Never ever enter your real acc# and/or password when
	not connecting to the CIP servers.
	Then you are logged in.

What's New?
	- many small fixes
	- you may change your outfit
	- player saving nows uses XML
	  and saves equipement
	- map saving now uses XML
	- you can walk using your mouse


How do I use this new stuff?
	Most stuff doesnt have to be explained. Expect perhaps the XML
	stuff wich isnt really important if you arent a programmer.
	What is important to mention is, that the way map-saves are made
	and loaded has changed a bit.
	The map is no longer called otserv.map but is now in data/world
	and is called map.xml It is generated when you use the save command
	the first time.
	If you want to load a map in the old format, you have to make sure,
	that map.xml *doesnt exist*.
	The order in which otserv will read the map is:
	1. map.xml
	2. then otserv.map
	3. generate empty map



How to use the old stuff?
	Create items by saying !i <itemid>
  	  see items.txt for item ids
	Delete items by saying !d
	Save the map by saying !s
	Shutdown the server by saying !q

Problems?
	If you should ever have problems, that your client
	crashes when you login, you have to delete the map
	(otserv.map) and replace it with otserv_default.map.
	TO USE MULTIPLAYER MAKE SURE YOUR COMPUTER DOESNT
	BLOCK PORT 7171
