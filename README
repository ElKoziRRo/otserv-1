otserv CVS
=======
What is this?
	otserv is a programm that acts like a tibia server.
	You can connect to it, walk around, talk, create items.

How does it work?
	Just start otserv.exe. Then, you need Tibia 7.1. 7.11
	doesnt work as you cant specify a server to connect to.
	Set the server IP in the client to 127.0.0.1
	Then connect like to the normal tibia server.
	Leave account number and password blank.
	Never ever enter your real acc# and/or password when
	not connecting to the CIP servers.
	Then you are logged in.

What's New?
	- lost of bugfixes


How do I use this new stuff?
	- lost of bugfixes
	  Mapsaving works without problems:
 	    deleting after save'n'load works and it doesnt
	    crash anymore
	  Items dont change places on the stack
	  You can push items under yourself


How to use the old stuff?
	Create items by saying !i <itemid>
  	  see items.txt for item ids
	Delete items by saying !d
	Save the map by saying !s
	Shutdown the server by saying !q

Problems?
	If you should ever have problems, that your client
	crashes when you login, you have to delete the map
	(otserv.map) and replace it with otserv_default.map.
	TO USE MULTIPLAYER MAKE SURE YOUR COMPUTER DOESNT
	BLOCK PORT 7171
