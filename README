otserv 0.2.4
---------------
What is this?
	otserv is a programm that acts like a tibia server.
	You can connect to it, walk around, talk, create items.

How does it work?
	Just start otserv.exe. Then, you need Tibia 7.1. 7.11
	doesnt work as you cant specify a server to connect to.
	Set the server IP in the client to 127.0.0.1
	Then connect like to the normal tibia server.
	Leave account number and password blank.
	Never ever enter your real acc# and/or password when
	not connecting to the CIP servers.
	Then you are logged in.

What's New?
	- item drag n drop

How do I use this new stuff?
	- item drag n drop
	  just like in real tibia you can now drag and drop items
	  on the map. dont try to drag items to or from your
	  equipement as it will crash. you cant move wall or ground
	  tiles either.

How to use the old stuff?
	Create items by saying !i <itemid>
  	  see items.txt for item ids
	Delete items by saying !d
	Save the map by saying !s
	Shutdown the server by saying !q

Problems?
	If you should ever have problems, that your client
	crashes when you login, you have to delete the map
	(otserv.map) and replace it with otserv_default.map.
	TO USE MULTIPLAYER MAKE SURE YOUR COMPUTER DOESNT
	BLOCK PORT 7171
