========== OpenTibia Server 0.6.2 ==========

What is this?
	OTServ is a free MMORPG emulation, that creates a own gameworld server,
	based on the CIPSoft's Tibia.

How does it work?
	In the past OTServ could be played on Tibia 7.1, 7.11, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.61, 7.7, 7.71, 7.8 and then 7.81.
	OTServ is now played using Tibia 8.11.

	To connect Tibia client to OTServ you will have to use an IP changer, you can get one here 
	http://otfans.net/attachment.php?attachmentid=1149 or http://otfans.net/showthread.php?t=20767.

	Once that's done, start the OTServ up, quite simple, just execute otserv.exe by
	double clicking it. Then startup Tibia by double clicking its shortcut you made earlier,
	then go to Options and Network and tick off "Test Server Login". Then login with the
	following:
		Account Number: 111111
		Password: tibia
	And check it out. Once you are done, have a look around in the folders
	and take a look at the config. :)

	NEVER ever enter your real acc# and/or password when
	not connecting to the CIP servers.
	Then you are logged in.

	Whats New in 0.6.2?
Features?
	- Not much

How do I use this new stuff?
	I'm just going over what might not be familiar to you here.

	The word "actions" might be unfamiliar to you. What it is an action?
	For instance when you click on a door it will open, or drinking mana-fluids.
	"movement" is any thing you do when moving: stepping in or out a tile, adding
	or removing an item from/to somewhere, equipping or de-equipping an item, etc..
	"talkactions" are like actions, but they mean for talking. So, everytime you
	say something, it's a talkaction.

	There is other cool stuff such as SQL-support. It includes MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL and ODBC support.
	Google it if you don't know it, we won't explain other softwares here ;p

	Binary map, well this seems quite new doesn't it. For a long time maps have been in xml format
	and nowadays some maps are like 20 megabytes large which takes quite long to load. So you can now
	convert your xml map to a binary map format by a simple converter. This can be found at the OTfans.net Forums.
