near future:
(Acrimon) I will implement keyboard events for the shell later.
(Acrimon) I will make both ServerSocket and EventScheduler a LOT better.
(Acrimon) error handling should be made better.
(Acrimon) add Windows code (but I cannot test that).
if you want to change anything now, best change ServerSocket::clientread::operator() only.
Comment out cout's and printf's if they are too many.
